# Transport Data Mini Hack: Routing Engines


As part of the the [Network Planning Tool for
Scotland](https://nptscot.github.io) project, we are looking to explore
different options for routing and associated data processing tasks.

We’ll run this session in 1 pars:

## Part 1: Data pre-processing and idea generation, 10:00-13:00

This will done asynchronously, with participants working alone or
in-person to generate input datasets and discuss needs.

## Part 2: Development and hacking, 14:00-16:00

This will be the ‘hackathon’ part of the day, where people will work
alone or in groups synchronously to develop code and test routing
solutions. We will set-up Microsoft Teams for anyone to contribute
remotely.

## Hack ideas

- Benchmarking different engines in terms of ease of setup, with
  Valhalla, Graphhopper, OSRM, and
  [AequilibraE](https://www.outerloop.io/blog/20240729_route_choice/)
  being options
- Ease of customising routing weights
- Network pre-processing, with reference to existing documentation,
  e.g. from
  [sDNA](https://sdna-plus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/network_preparation.html)

## Logistics

We have in-person space at the University of Leeds from 10:00, get in
touch if you’d like to join remotely or in person if you don’t know
where to find us.

## Sharing code

You can put code whereever you like but please do share reproducible
examples with a link to your code and by putting the code here directly
with pull requests to this repository. We will share input datasets in
the Releases of this repository.
